title: Exercise 33
---

In this exercise we will implement a hash table.

1. Create a working directory somewhere on your computer. Open your command line terminal and make a working directory. Then change to that directory.

2. Clone the assignment for today. Accept the GitHub classroom invitation. This will automatically add this repository accessible to you and the instructor/TAs with some starter files. You can then clone it to your computer using

	```
	git clone https://github.com/VT-ECE-3514/spring23-ex33-USER.git
	```
	
	where USER is your GitHub username. You may have to enter your GitHub 
	username and password.

3. Implement the add method in ``hash_dictionary.tpp``.

4. Add the updates to your repository and commit the changes, e.g.

	```
	git add -u
   	git commit -m "implemented hash add method"
	```
	
5. Use git push to synchronize the repository with that on GitHub

	```git push```
	
	You may have to enter your GitHub username and password again.

You have now completed the exercise.
